Write a functions that takes in a Binary Tree and returns a list if its branch sums ordered from leftmost branch sum to its rightmost branch sum.

class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

O(N) Time Complexity | O(N) Space Complexity

def branchSums(root):
    sums = []
    runningSum = 0
    calculateBranchSums(root,runningSum,sums)
    return sums
    
def calculateBranchSums(tree,runningSum,sums):
  
  if tree is None:
    return
    
  runningSum += tree.value
  
  if tree.left is None and tree.right is None:
    sums.append(runningSum)
    return
      
  calculateBranchSums(tree.left, runningSum, sums)
  calculateBranchSums(tree.right, runningSum, sums)
